        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p >
            My name is Zackery Arsement and I am a recent graduate from the University of Texas at Austin, where I received a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering. After graduation I worked on video game designing and programming for 6 months using C# in the Unity Game Engine. I then got a job at a chemical plant in the Beaumont, Texas area. After working at the plant for 6 months I realized that the oil and gas industry was not for me and I wanted to switch back into software and code for a living. I am now working full time on UT's javaScript bootcamp and I am very enthusiastic about my future in software!

            <p>
                Through learning html, css, javascript and javascript based programs I plan to propel myself into a future career of web development. I enjoy the design and problem solving aspects of coding, and there are very few things in life that are more satisfying than seeing your work implemented and put into effect in real time such as web development. Software is a constantly evolving industry and I enjoy knowing that I will always be learning in a software career. I hope to constantly grow in my javascript knowledge and add more coding languages and programs into my arsenal of knowledge.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                On a personal level I hope to utilize the freedom and flexibility that software development jobs provide. I prioritize ministry and family above all else and software development is optimal for work home balance.
